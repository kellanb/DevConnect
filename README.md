# H2 Description

DevConnect is a web application created to help DFW-based companies find web development/design help in their own back yard.  DevConnect offers the perks of similar online platforms but with the benefit of locally sourcing talent.  These benefits include easy, direct contact with a member of the local community with the option for face-to-face meetings.  In addition, all profiles are reviewed to ensure the highest quality of work.  Businesses are able to post jobs or view developer's resumes and portfolios.  Local developers are able to view job postings and apply for projects, as well as view additional developer resources that have been compiled by the DevConnect team.
